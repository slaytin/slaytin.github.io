It is why I am here, to explore and build up a good answer to that question.\r\n\r\n### About the Username\r\nI used to play Counter-Strike when I was young, and I thought I was too good, so I used the username space to provoke my opponents into slaying me.. tin being the last 3 letters of my name... a handle was born (thunder crackles in the near distance)!\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nIs a great tool, much appreciated and I hope to give back to those Designer Templates someday. I hadn't even realized GitHub hosts pages. Woot! (is what I write instead of Neat! or Cool!, I still mean both..)\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIs not a thing for me yet, although it wouldn't hurt to give a shot at replicating this minimalist template, which I still think would be beyond my current skill.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI'm going to mention @slaytin and see how this looks.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\nI will definitely leave that last paragraph untouched and only add on this little sentence to NOT touch the support contacts, let's say there is a possibility I could forget it ever existed.",

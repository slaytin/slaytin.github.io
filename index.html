        <h2>2017-03-16</h2>
        <p> Well after some doodling around at Free Code Camp, I would now like to start applying for a few entry level positions, just to get a taste of the atmosphere. JUST one thing left to do before that, see/learn about testing, maybe focus on java since of its higher employment.. just to get started somewhere ofcourse.. LATER!!

        <p> Well that calculator will have to wait, I have returned to brush up on the front end (because that seems to be a decent place to break into as a newb).
          so I will be making some colorful changes for now since those are my abilities, but to me it is still something. Piece!</p>

        <h2> 2017-02-23 </h2>
        <p> a week in, and I have done NOTHING about what I said last week. I think I just show up here to make myself feel productive (wow lol), I will attempt it again today, have something soothing playing in the background and viola! lets get the show on the road.</p>
 
        <br/><h2> Feb. 16, 2017</h2>
        <p> Today I would like to start setting myself goals (publicly), thankfully no one else will be seeing this, but still, I need to make sure I go through with it. It's on record somewhere!!</p>
        <p> I would like to start on something that would likely interest me the most, a big calculator-- by which I mean a calculator that can handle big numbers (past 64bit).</p>
 
        <p> I need to start with small steps to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Get back in a coding flow </li>
          <li> Keep things simple, easier to keep track </li>
          <li> Re-learn basic math (and some advanced further down) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> I will start today with a simple version, that only does the basics, and keeps the numbers small. It;s not what I want, but I just need to start somewhere. This will be done using python (for now), as I am most familiar(not at all) with it.</p>

<p>I like playing games that involve destroying robots-- tin being the metal they're made from... I slay tin</p>

<p>Is a great tool, much appreciated and I hope to give back to those Designer Templates someday. I hadn't even realized GitHub hosts pages. Woot! (is what I write instead of Neat! or Cool!, I still mean both..)</p>

<p>Is not a thing for me yet, although it wouldn't hurt to give a shot at replicating this minimalist template, which I still think would be beyond my current skill.</p>

<p>I will definitely leave that last paragraph untouched and only add on this little sentence to NOT touch the support contacts, let's say there is a possibility I could forget it ever existed.</p>

        <h2> 2018-09-29</h2>
          <p> Day 3 meow, I hope to have a cable running down there, or maybe since I still don't have much to deploy I should get started with the TDD by the goat. That will also come with some python refreshers.. hang in there! </p> <br/>
        <h2> 2018-09-28</h2>
          <p> I managed to install an ubuntu server on the laptop and now I will try to see if it is possible to connect to internet via WiFi. Just for initial updates and maybe messing around with git a bit. </p>
          <p> I will start the TDD over again, maybe things will be fresh, and I also hope the dependencies are not some super modern day crap where newer gecko will have trouble functioning. It also seems that the Ubuntu server is all CLI, or I just haven't look far enough for a graphical UI. But this way we can struggle some with our bash/force some learns on the way..</p>
          <p> Anyways I will try to see if running an ethernet down there is even possible these days with the 4th slot being taken by the TV for netflix etc.. even though it is right above the modem... It should have some sorta wifi!? Need to talk about it with brov see if he has any intel/opposition. And if not, red cable will be activated once again.</p><br/>
        <h2> 2018-09-28 </h2>
          <p> Wow look at us blogging! 3rd update in 2 days, only 363 more to go. Seriously, I hope this updating keeps me on track with setting up the serv and giving TDD one more try. I was too close last time, now I will have to skim the beginning parts and see what will be possible.</p> <p> Wish me luck, I am going in full force with this CentOS. I will have to partition it, and I hope that choice comes up while installing, if not, I might just stick it all over the Ubuntu. </p>
        
        <h2> again.. 2018-09-27 </h2>
          <p> Evening update: Thankfully the ubuntu usb stick managed to install successfully and now it looks lioke the laptop downstairs will live. I also managed to update(/replace?) the wifi driver since the one that came stock did not work initially. I managed to learn a bit about just downloading .deb package files onto a USB stick and dpkg -i on the new OS. This helped me get my wifi going and I hope it sticks around for other OSes. The pain I avoided was to either take an ethernet cord down there which is a short pain but I wont do that until I have a server OS set up for deployment. The other option was to bring it upstairs to quickly use my PC ethernet cord, but the major pains with that are that the battery is useless so it needs a constant power connection and that just surpasses the other pains in cleaning/dusting webs from the laptop and the whole power cord! Thinking back, that would've ended up being my choice, the worst one of all. It definitely would have been bad planning. Take note, calculate pains before making choices (when possible).</p> 
          <p> I went way off on this rant, and oh here we go: I will now give installing CentOS another shot. Probably partition the Ubuntu down the middle and hope this CentOS installs. Also, be on the lookout for small changes in the bash environment? maybe just different pkg naming etc, nothing too major (I hope). I hope to also keep these updates going.. </p> <br/>
        <h2> Two YEARS!?!  2018-09-27 </h2>	
          <p> Feels like two years, but at least I did leave some dates up. I also feel like going back and changing some of the language used.. it definitely does not reflect how I speak IRL. So where have I been the last year and a half? Hmm last I remember I was going through some TDD book, and was really looking forward to deploying my own server (old rusty laptop I had not much use for, so why not learn). Well I happened to eff the boot/ partitions pretty hard, since it has not functioned properly since. I have gotten used to just livebooting on it and using it to learn bash at least. These days I have been making new attempts at reviving/installing a server on it, I might even continue the TDD after.. but will I even be able to breakthrough and start this damn thing?! Stay tuned! </p>

        <p> Well after some doodling around at Free Code Camp, I would now like to start applying for a few entry level positions, just to get a taste of the atmosphere. JUST one thing left to do before that, see/learn about testing, maybe focus on java since of its higher employment.. just to get started somewhere ofcourse.. LATER!!

        <p> Well that calculator will have to wait, I have returned to brush up on the front end (because that seems to be a decent place to break into as a newb).
          so I will be making some colorful changes for now since those are my abilities, but to me it is still something. Piece!</p>

        <h2> 2017-02-23 </h2>
        <p> a week in, and I have done NOTHING about what I said last week. I think I just show up here to make myself feel productive (wow lol), I will attempt it again today, have something soothing playing in the background and viola! lets get the show on the road.</p>
 
        <br/><h2> Feb. 16, 2017</h2>
        <p> Today I would like to start setting myself goals (publicly), thankfully no one else will be seeing this, but still, I need to make sure I go through with it. It's on record somewhere!!</p>
        <p> I would like to start on something that would likely interest me the most, a big calculator-- by which I mean a calculator that can handle big numbers (past 64bit).</p>
 
        <p> I need to start with small steps to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Get back in a coding flow </li>
          <li> Keep things simple, easier to keep track </li>
          <li> Re-learn basic math (and some advanced further down) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> I will start today with a simple version, that only does the basics, and keeps the numbers small. It;s not what I want, but I just need to start somewhere. This will be done using python (for now), as I am most familiar(not at all) with it.</p>

<p>Is a great tool, much appreciated and I hope to give back to those Designer Templates someday. I hadn't even realized GitHub hosts pages. Woot! (is what I write instead of Neat! or Cool!, I still mean both..)</p>

        <h2>2018-10-14</h2>
          <p> Ok just a quick reminder for tomorrow me: split your unit testing up to see which is unit and which are functional, also check Goat TDD it had wisdom in that very topic.. and it looks like we survived another week. Time is flying. Let's keep these positive sidetracks clear!</p>
        <h2>2018-10-13</h2>
          <p>Well well well well.. if it isn't mr sorta stuck. I think this can clear up by tomorrow. Oh I have finally started writing some parts of unit tests and now I can't even code them to pass.. unless I use some funky hacky ways that stick out in the templates.. I was hoping I can figure out the queryset in the views to return only the questions which already have choices on them, and skip the others.. just how it skips all the future published ones and the old ones too, I need it to skip[ the ones with no choice.. do I need some other connection between both models? doesn't sound too right. Theres gta be a decent filter command to get me what I need, or I should atleast try to simplify it down in the views, add some helper funcs? I think some sleep can help clear things up.. gnite</p>
        <h2> 12th part two</h2>
          <p>I surprised myself by finishing the testing introductory tutorial. I do agree that I was half distracted going through it so it wont hurt going over it again or just completely diving into the testing in django pages. It seems to be the place to get best accustomed to it. I will flip a coin between that and just finishing the tutorial after the next short section which is just adding CSS and other static files. </p>
        <ul>TO DO
          <li>Add more tests of your own as suggested at the end of the testing chapter.</li>
          <li> Refactor</li>
          <li>deploy app live</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> 2018-10-12</h2>
          <p> Hurray I finally got to the testing part of the django tutorial.. Kinda feels like I am slowly walking. I also managed to throw in a few variables of my own in the poll app.. As a sidetrack we can just mess around coding {% %} sorta loops and {{ }} variables for in a django environment. Maybe after doing the testing tut we can take a look at the Goat TDD, or continue with django, both are decently fine. I find that there is a whole lot to learn for django basics before I go off to the goat tdd. I mean it is djangos own tutorial so that makes sense. It is friday night and looks like I will be hitting the hay early again. Waking up around 5 and didn't even nap. It is expected. Doing these django stuff is kinda giving me a high, noooice.</p>
        <h2> before I forget 2019-10-11</h2>
          <p>Still on that django tutorial but I'd just like to point out that there is some depth that takes digging. Also the documentation looks to be good, you should be able to find lotsa decent examples if ever you run into something </p>
          <p>Another small discovery of late yesternight, Django's MVC (model view controller) is actually more like MTV (Model Template View) where template is pretty much the view and the view methods in python look to be the controller (where you specify the template to be rendered). Now practice throwing apps up (including having lots of testing) and by now I mean whenever I am done with the django tutorial + the Test Driven Development with our goat mascot. Anyways, keep up the good work, always try to have interesting/relevant sidetracks for whenever you feel like sidetracking. After spawning a few apps and deploying them locally(look to practice your script writing/sysadmin skill and mess around with setting them up on a postgresql db), see what it is like cloudwise:what are the similarities? differences?  </p>
        <h2> feels late 2019-10-09</h2>
          <p>Sooo Django tutorial is going oK. Lotsa valuable looking resources for django, it would feel better going back to the goat with a small BG in hango.. Keep it going, also lotsa and lots of side docs for postgres etc Feel free to review the last half of the instructions, try to see why it is being used.. Gnite, eyes are drowsy.. shuteye now</p>
        <h2>snag? 2018-10-08</h2>
          <p> Whaaaat cmon lets go!? The goat is waiting.. Easy to follow instructions.. Teaching you the importancy of tests, everybody does 'em! Everyone. You can do this, you are on the sidetracks but might as well go into the side track material, just some mild introductions to django, or the selenium geckodriver abilities.. cmon!! also, shanghai open has started this week, so there is some daily entertainment for you</p>
        <h2> 2018-10-05</h2>
          <p> welp it is not hapopening this weekend, atleast be sure to go over some django tutorial or dive into terminal vids.. go over your bookmarks.. organize. This is starting to look like a todo list but might as well make it into that since we haven't done much with the book project. anyways, just dove into some kodi files,, a buncha DB with some cache here and there, some thumbnails which I cleared up.. was a good 2gig i think. Back straight, and hands on the qwerty, look ahead, you will be fine.</p>
        <h2> 2018-10-04</h2>
          <p> Ok this chapter 5 went way longer than the previous. No complaints.. ran into a little database idea. Since in the book django by default is using SQlite which is supposedly just a file somewhere, for extra learns, we should connect this to Postgres on the live server.. eventually? first do it by the book is my point, then jump off and swim on your own a bit with postgresql.. you have heard good things of this, and it could be better overall for serv.</p>
          <p> Also, grab the code from the random quote generator? Just put it on your homepage. Do some copy pasta see where that jquery code should go.</p>
        <h2> 2018-10-03</h2>
          <p> Was this || close to not making todays entry. So I hit the book yesterday, and it has been a little tougher to look at today. I think I should be nearing chapter 4, the app and the crazy amount of tests have started to come together. I also started a VCS (vers control system) using Git. I will most likely end up migrating here once time comes for a live serv deployment. Hmm who knows I might even link it here once it starts.</p>
          <p> You got this though, the instructions are simple and easy to follow. Why meowt just hit it? It is wedn ... wot m8 it felt like a thursday these past few hours. Anyways, simple instructions, try to learn yeh? Django, selenium, geckodriver.. leggo </p>
        <h2> 2018-10-01</h2>
          <p> Heck, finally found a very easy setup guide for the ubuntu server. Turns out, and I didn't seem to think much of this, but it turns out I was reading a newer setup guide and some commands were different. Now I found the specific version guide and it was a breeze. Next - back to TDD with the goat. I also located/made changes to the index on the server. SO far so good, lets get used to deploying app(s). TDD here I come. </p> <br/>
        <h2> 2018-09-30</h2>
          <p> Well finally found how to indent, should be simpler with a touch of CSS. Also I have updated most of the server stuff and I am halfway through a basic deployment checklist. Feels good to end the weekend with an excited high, at this point after I fully get through the checklist, I will start on TDD again, no need to rush, but a side goal of catching up to where we were before by the end of next week would mean that the excitement is still there. Anyways it is getting late and I hoped to keep this short. Have fun!</p> <br/>
        <h2> 2018-09-30 </h2>
          <p style="text-indent:20px"> Funday update. Saturday was definitely less productive for me, now we have to be on the lookout for the unproductive cycle. And squash it when found. This typing here I really think will start me off on the right path. It shows me that my QWERTY needs some work. The fingers' muscles need to be flexed, and get their memories in check. Saw some doc recommended and found it on youtube, so I will try to take a peek at it, even though it is about war and I doubt I can find the patience for this piece of wash. I will most likely leave it for after I finish the Boondock Saints.. it is not my first time viewing it but it is the first time I am listening to the commentary alongside.</p>
          <p>   It is time for a new paragraph. It appears the way to indent the start of the new paragraph is to either just press tab, or insert some white space through the use of the spacebar. These are both guesses so I have tried the tab for indenting the beginning here. Also, beginning? what a weird word to spell. Dno but I think I had a brain fart with it. Good news! it must mean my brains are there.</p> 
        <p>    Nope tab does not do it. Now this para is whitespaced.. here we go.</p> <br/>
        <h2> 2018-09-29</h2>
          <p> Day 3 meow, I hope to have a cable running down there, or maybe since I still don't have much to deploy I should get started with the TDD by the goat. That will also come with some python refreshers.. hang in there! </p> <br/>
        <h2> 2018-09-28</h2>
          <p> I managed to install an ubuntu server on the laptop and now I will try to see if it is possible to connect to internet via WiFi. Just for initial updates and maybe messing around with git a bit. </p>
          <p> I will start the TDD over again, maybe things will be fresh, and I also hope the dependencies are not some super modern day crap where newer gecko will have trouble functioning. It also seems that the Ubuntu server is all CLI, or I just haven't look far enough for a graphical UI. But this way we can struggle some with our bash/force some learns on the way..</p>
          <p> Anyways I will try to see if running an ethernet down there is even possible these days with the 4th slot being taken by the TV for netflix etc.. even though it is right above the modem... It should have some sorta wifi!? Need to talk about it with brov see if he has any intel/opposition. And if not, red cable will be activated once again.</p><br/>
        <h2> 2018-09-28 </h2>
          <p> Wow look at us blogging! 3rd update in 2 days, only 363 more to go. Seriously, I hope this updating keeps me on track with setting up the serv and giving TDD one more try. I was too close last time, now I will have to skim the beginning parts and see what will be possible.</p> <p> Wish me luck, I am going in full force with this CentOS. I will have to partition it, and I hope that choice comes up while installing, if not, I might just stick it all over the Ubuntu. </p>
        
        <h2> again.. 2018-09-27 </h2>
          <p> Evening update: Thankfully the ubuntu usb stick managed to install successfully and now it looks lioke the laptop downstairs will live. I also managed to update(/replace?) the wifi driver since the one that came stock did not work initially. I managed to learn a bit about just downloading .deb package files onto a USB stick and dpkg -i on the new OS. This helped me get my wifi going and I hope it sticks around for other OSes. The pain I avoided was to either take an ethernet cord down there which is a short pain but I wont do that until I have a server OS set up for deployment. The other option was to bring it upstairs to quickly use my PC ethernet cord, but the major pains with that are that the battery is useless so it needs a constant power connection and that just surpasses the other pains in cleaning/dusting webs from the laptop and the whole power cord! Thinking back, that would've ended up being my choice, the worst one of all. It definitely would have been bad planning. Take note, calculate pains before making choices (when possible).</p> 
          <p> I went way off on this rant, and oh here we go: I will now give installing CentOS another shot. Probably partition the Ubuntu down the middle and hope this CentOS installs. Also, be on the lookout for small changes in the bash environment? maybe just different pkg naming etc, nothing too major (I hope). I hope to also keep these updates going.. </p> <br/>
        <h2> Two YEARS!?!  2018-09-27 </h2>	
          <p> Feels like two years, but at least I did leave some dates up. I also feel like going back and changing some of the language used.. it definitely does not reflect how I speak IRL. So where have I been the last year and a half? Hmm last I remember I was going through some TDD book, and was really looking forward to deploying my own server (old rusty laptop I had not much use for, so why not learn). Well I happened to eff the boot/ partitions pretty hard, since it has not functioned properly since. I have gotten used to just livebooting on it and using it to learn bash at least. These days I have been making new attempts at reviving/installing a server on it, I might even continue the TDD after.. but will I even be able to breakthrough and start this damn thing?! Stay tuned! </p>

        <p> Well after some doodling around at Free Code Camp, I would now like to start applying for a few entry level positions, just to get a taste of the atmosphere. JUST one thing left to do before that, see/learn about testing, maybe focus on java since of its higher employment.. just to get started somewhere ofcourse.. LATER!!

        <p> Well that calculator will have to wait, I have returned to brush up on the front end (because that seems to be a decent place to break into as a newb).
          so I will be making some colorful changes for now since those are my abilities, but to me it is still something. Piece!</p>
        <br/>
     
        
        <h2> 2017-02-23 </h2>
        <p> a week in, and I have done NOTHING about what I said last week. I think I just show up here to make myself feel productive (wow lol), I will attempt it again today, have something soothing playing in the background and viola! lets get the show on the road.</p>
 
        <br/><h2> Feb. 16, 2017</h2>
        <p> Today I would like to start setting myself goals (publicly), thankfully no one else will be seeing this, but still, I need to make sure I go through with it. It's on record somewhere!!</p>
        <p> I would like to start on something that would likely interest me the most, a big calculator-- by which I mean a calculator that can handle big numbers (past 64bit).</p>
 
        <p> I need to start with small steps to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Get back in a coding flow </li>
          <li> Keep things simple, easier to keep track </li>
          <li> Re-learn basic math (and some advanced further down) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> I will start today with a simple version, that only does the basics, and keeps the numbers small. It;s not what I want, but I just need to start somewhere. This will be done using python (for now), as I am most familiar(not at all) with it.</p>
